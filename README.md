This repository contains my solutions to a variety of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. The problems are categorized into different topics such as Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming.

Each file includes:

✅ Java implementation of the problem

✅ Explanation of the approach (brute force and optimized when possible)

✅ Time and Space Complexity analysis

The purpose of this repository is to:

Strengthen my problem-solving and logical thinking skills

Build a solid foundation in core DSA concepts

Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming

Share solutions that may help others in their learning journey

This repo will be updated regularly with new problems and solutions.

Thank You!!!
